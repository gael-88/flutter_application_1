🎨 What is Rive?

Rive is a real-time animation tool that lets designers and developers create interactive vector animations that run smoothly in apps, games, and websites — without coding complex motion manually.

It allows you to design, animate, and embed assets that respond to user input in real-time.

🧠 What is a State Machine in Rive?

A State Machine in Rive controls how an animation changes based on user interactions or logic.
It defines inputs (like booleans, numbers, or triggers) that determine which animation state should play — for example:

Typing starts an animation 👇

Submitting triggers a success or fail animation ✅❌

This makes animations interactive and logic-driven, rather than static.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🧩 Flutter — UI framework

🎬 Rive — animation integration

🧠 StateMachineController — for handling animation logic

💻 Dart — programming language
